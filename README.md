Adventine
=========

A small text adventure originally made for a programming class.


**Install instructions:**
---------------------
- You need Ruby 1.9.x, 1.8.x is known to not work with Adventine's die roller

- You don't install anything except *maybe* Ruby, you can just run adventineII2.0.rb


**Linux/Mac:**
----------
In terminal type:

	ruby adventineII2.0.rb

**or**

	./adventineII2.0.rb

- Make sure you are in the same directory as the file


**Windows:**
--------
- Download ruby: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/#rubyinstaller

- See Linux/Mac steps

- Warning: Windows will not be able to use the "--update" argument unless you have some form of "wget" installed that can be used by the command prompt

- Warning: Windows may or may not be able to run Adventine without invoking adventineII2.0.rb using "ruby"
